# SimpleHorrorGame
SimpleHorrorGame is a little website I wrote while trying to understanding three.js and WebGL. It's a really simple web horror game, which basically only allows you to walk in a really foggy forest and there's monster randomly poping out in the forest. 

This app is a fun side project I built within 3 days, as a learning process.
